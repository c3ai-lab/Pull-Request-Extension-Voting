## deVote - blockchain based voting system for pull requests

deVote is a browser extension for decentralised voting of pull requests in GitHub repositories. For the decentralisation of the voting mechanism, smart contracts are used, which run on the Ethereum blockchain or an Ethereum testnet. This project was developed as part of the university course *"Kryptographie und Systemsicherheit"* at the [University of Flensburg](https://hs-flensburg.de/).
