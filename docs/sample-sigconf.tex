\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Open source development on GitHub}
Open source development is a type of software development in which a decentralised and collaborative 
community develops software publicly and transparently. Open source development enables the creation 
of innovative and free software through the collaboration of many people, and it also provides free access 
to the software for everyone \cite{shaikh2017governing, redhat2021ops}. Some examples for such significant 
projects are the Linux Kernel \cite{linux2021ops} and the Mozilla Firefox browser \cite{mozilla2021ops}, which are 
used by many people  every day. A particular difficulty in open source development is the coordination of the many 
developers who contribute to the development of the projects with their own extensions or improvements. Changes have 
to be tracked, traced and, if necessary, reversed \cite{shaikh2017governing}. These problems occur not only in open 
source development, but also in normal software development. As in normal software development, version control is 
used to solve these problems \cite{shaikh2017governing, ulrich2020dev}. \\ \\
In particular, the version control protocol Git 
is ideally for open source development, because with Git it is possible to have several distributed remotes that can 
access and manage the same source code \cite{git2021scm, ulrich2020dev}. Projects that are coordinated via git are 
called repositories. The developers have a local copy of the repository on their systems and can push their changes to or 
pull the current status from the main repository. These actions are coordinated via a so-called git server, which has to be 
hosted somewhere so that the developers can work with it \cite{git2021scm}. It is important that this server is permanently 
accessible, otherwise the actions mentioned will no longer work. and coordination of the repository will be 
interrupted \cite{ulrich2020dev}. Hosting services such as GitHub were created so that such problems can be prevented 
and not everyone has to set up their own git server if they want to start an open source project \cite{ulrich2020dev, git2021hub}.
GitHub is the largest git hosting provider today, with over 56 million registered developers and over 100 million repositories.
\cite{git2021hub} The service is also used by large IT corporations such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google and hosts a large 
number of the largest and most important open source repositories \cite{git2021stars}.\\ \\
Normally, an open source project on GitHub starts with a user creating a repository for it. The user who created the 
repository is the owner of it. This user has full control over the repository and can push changes, decide which changes are 
accepted (merged) and even delete the repository. In addition, he can add so-called collaborators to the repository, who have 
read and write rights in the repository \cite{git2021rights}. Normal users who do not have collaboration rights can contribute to 
the open source project by creating a pull request with their change. Another user with the necessary rights can then decide 
whether the change is useful or not. Depending on his decision, he can merge (accept) or reject (reject) the changes. 
The described process is the typical approach to how the community develops for an open source project.


\subsection{Problem}
The described workflow for managing repositories on GitHub but also on other hosting services such as GitLab or Bitbucket has 
some significant disadvantages. Firstly this approach is not necessarily decentralised or democratic. Very few people usually have 
the necessary rights to merge pull requests, and they can decide over the head of the general community whether to merge or reject
 a pull request. So it doesn't matter what the general community thinks, as long as the administrators have a different opinion. Rejecting
 good or useful pull requests is bad, but not a direct threat to the project. The opposite is to merge a critical bug into the main repository,
 which can cause enormous damage, as in the example of the Heartbleed bug in the Open SSL repository \cite{ioriheartbleed}. This 
danger exists mainly because it only takes one person with the necessary rights to overlook the bug and decide to merge the flawed 
pull request. Less critical problems, which nevertheless complicate the work in the communities of open source projects, are the lack
 of initiative for developers to review pull requests or to create pull requests themselves. If an open source repository is not financially
 supported by a company or a large community, they usually live on developers who work on these projects in their spare time, which 
means that further development sometimes takes a very long time. 


\subsection{Solution}
To solve these problems, this paper presents the development of a chrome browser extension that uses the GitHub API and the 
Ethereum blockchain to enable decentralised management of pull requests in GitHub repositories with a financial incentive for 
the community. Using the Ethereum Blockchain, the community can vote on which pull requests should be merged or rejected,
 with decisions to merge good requests and reject bad ones being rewarded. In addition, the community can use a crowdfunding
 mechanism to pool Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, to pay developers for solving problems or bugs. The
 functioning of the protocol on which the browser extension is based is explained in detail in \textit{3. Protocol}. Our goal with
 this browser extension and this paper is to solve the problems mentioned and to improve the way open source development 
is done.

\section{Related work}
Related work falls into three areas: \textit{repository governance}, \textit{decentralised voting} and \textit{developer initiative}. 
Previous work has already looked at decentralised approaches to manage GitHub repositories. One work pursues the idea that 
a repository always belongs to the ownerless protocol and that pull requests can only be merged or rejected by the community 
via this protocol. This should prevent the danger that users with writing rights misuse them \cite{ulrich2020dev}. \\ \\
Furthermore trustless and decentralised voting on the blockchain is a topic that has been addressed in several papers 
and which also plays a critical role in this paper \cite{khoury2018decentralized, ulrich2020dev}. \\ \\
In addition, the lack of financial incentive to implement problems or changes in a repository is an issue that has been investigated. 
The research looked at what is important to the developer who solves the bounty and what is important to the financial backer of 
the bounty. \cite{zhou2019bounties}
